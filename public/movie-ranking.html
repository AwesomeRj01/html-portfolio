<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3 movies of the last decade.</h2>

<hr/>
<h3>Tamasha</h3>
<p>The story of the movie is fresh and how everyone of us are stuck in out lives playing the monotonous when we wanted to lead an interersting life living and realising our passion. This movie deals with a romantic drama and in the end how hero realises that he doesnt want to get stuck into the boring monotonous life.</p>

<h3>Barfi</h3>
<p>This is also a romantic drama directed by anurag basu featuring Ranbir kapoor, Illeana D'cruz and priyanka chopra. It is really a heartful movie of how love needs nothing more than two people who care for each other and not other worldly things.</p>

<h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3>
<p>One of its kind movie, a travel drama where three friends take out their time to go a bachleors trip to spain and outdo each of their fears during the trip realising various new things in their lives</p>
